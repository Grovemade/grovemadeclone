### Introduction

### About the Project

Grovemade Clone is a Full Stack (SQL, Express, Angular, Node) web application. It is a fully functional clone of grovemade.com, a beautifully designed eCommerce site that sells handcrafted wooden accessories for apple products. We choose this site because it was chalk full of challenging CSS effects. This project also required a lot of logic organizing our tables and foreign keys to best return the information we needed on each product. We learned a lot together as team. I hope you enjoy the site!
